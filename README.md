# recipe_search_app
A simple Python app that uses the Edamam Recipe Search API (v1) to pull up a list of recipes based on an ingredient </br>
This was coded for a final project for the Intro to Python course on <a href="https://codefirstgirls.com/">Code First Girls</a>.

By inputting an ingredient, selecting a mealType, and optionally adding an ingredient to be excluded, the user can search for recipes based on their characteristics.
These recipes will be printed to the screen and saved to a recipes.txt.
The txt file should be overwritten with every search to avoid a huge list of recipes for the user.

After running, there is a small unit converter included, the use of this is optional.</br>
If improving the app, it could be an idea to create this in a separate function, and also find a separate unit converter utility that can be called instead.
